# Sugarcoat

**The Orchestration Layer for Event-Driven ROS2 Systems**

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.6; opacity: 0.9;">
  Sugarcoat is a <b>meta-framework</b> that replaces fragmented <strong>ROS2</strong> development with a unified workflow, offering a high-level API to build robust components and orchestrate them into cohesive, self-healing systems. It replaces verbose boilerplate and static launch files with an <b>Event-Driven API</b>, allowing you to orchestrate complex robotic behaviors with the elegance of modern Python.
